# damage-simulation
Runs a damage simulation between two fighters from the Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 system

The reason I love programming most is, with a few hours, only about a hundred lines of code, and an idea you can solve a problem that has existed for years, or longer.
I wrote this app to solve a debate years ago I had with a friend about DnD fighters, which was better? The dual wielder, or a power-striking two-hander? I always said dual-wielder.
With the same stats, levels, and weapons, with differing feats chosen to suit their play-style, it turns out the dual wielder wins hands down if he builds around critical strike.
